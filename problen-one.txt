Write a PHP class that inherits from PHP's ArrayObject class. 

Give your new class a public function called showTable() that outputs all the set keys and values as an HTML table. 

Instantiate an instance of this class, set some keys for the object, and call the object's showTable() function to display your data as an HTML table.
